    steps:
      # Workflows need to checkout the repo before they can work with it
      # You can specify the repo to be checked out to pull in other code
      # If you do not specify, the default is the repo the workflow runs from
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Github-hosted runners come with several node versions installed (and much more!)
      # If you don't setup a specific version, the latest version is used
      # This repo uses node 12, so let's stick to that when running the workflow
      - name: Use Node.js 12
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 12
      
      # You don't have to specify a name for your steps - usually a good idea, though
      # - run: cd src && npm install
      
      # Usually it's best to avoid using `cd` in favor of `working-directory`
      - name: Install dependencies
        # Most actions support `working-directory` - this tells the runner to execute this
        # step in the directory we specify. Since our package.json is in src, execute there
        working-directory: src
        run: npm install
        

      # And now we can run our tests! It's the same as we would locally
